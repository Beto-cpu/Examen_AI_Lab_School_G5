# AI Lab School G5 Exam

This repository contains two projects that serve as evaluation for the AI Lab School's Artificial Intelligence course.

## Stroke Prediction

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) that demonstrates the complete cycle of development of an artificial intelligence model, both Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to predict the occurrence of a stroke.

The file explains the following steps:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Training of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models
- Evaluation of models and selection of the best one

## Time Series Forecasting

This project shows the process of deploying a time series forecasting application using Flask and Docker.

The app.py file is the Flask application that handles forecast requests and returns results, while the Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image and set up the execution environment.
